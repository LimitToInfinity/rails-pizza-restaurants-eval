Before you begin, fork and clone this repo, run `bundle install`, `rake db:migrate` and `rake db:seed` to get started.

## The Domain
You've just been hired by the 'NYC Pizza Society' - congratulations! The devoted members want you to develop a website that will allow them to record their favorite spots and eats. To do this, we need a way to keep track of the gazillion NYC Pizza joints and record the favorites pizzas for each location.

Luckily, another developer has already started the job. We have a controller, model and views to support the creation, listing and display of pizzerias. Visiting `/pizzerias` displays all of the pizzerias recorded by members. Unfortunately we don't have a way for members to record their favorite pizzas for each pizzeria. Each Pizzeria can have many pizzas and each pizza belongs to a Pizzeria.
